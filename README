Design: This simulation represents a traffic intersection. Vehicles are represented as pointers
        on the roadway. When a vehicle moves, the pointers are updated to the next destination in the
        roadway if the move is possible.

        Roadway is represented as Vector of vectors --> of type vehicle pointers. similar to  a 2D-Array.

        TrafficLight is represented as a class. It controls the movement of cars based on color.

        Simulation class controls the entire simulation of the project. When the code is run,
        simulation controls the entire simulation of the project by calling necessary classes and methods from
        specified classes and updating data accordingly.


Compile: make

Run : ./Simulation [input file] [initial seed]
